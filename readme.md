- Enter the URL of the Wikipedia page containing the table(s).
- Press "Convert".
- Copy the results to your clipboard or download it as CSV file.
- Put the CSV results into the google sheets spreadsheet (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hWU-xIQHR5fSL-WhjhpZ03f9Z-rLOzx8tqjktpyRVVE/edit#gid=1852788929)
- Import that spreadsheet into Airtable (have to do sheets -> airtable unless you want to pay money)

**Tip:** to use the data in Excel or similar spreadsheet applications paste the result from your clipboard into the first cell of your spreadsheet (or open the downloaded file). Set the delimiter character to "comma".
